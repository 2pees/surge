If youâ€™re using tools like Grunt, Gulp, or a static site generator like Jekyll, your files are output into a compile directory like `_site/`, `build/`, or `www/`. From the root of your project, pass Surge the path to this directory to upload your compiled assets.

    surge www

You may also add this directory to your `.gitignore` to keep your compiled assets out of your Git history.
